			<title>Quality</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">At Zong Yih, quality starts when our clients send us their projects. Our design department will first analyze the new design, following for control program and process capability evaluations.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Realize that the importance of production process is based on the performance of our people in very aspect, we have trained our people to the highest standard of their skills.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our people are working with their utmost skills and experiences to produce the quality products for our customers, we are put the great effort to ensure that our products will meet customer's specification and their quality expectations.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>ISO9001:2008</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To achieve the high degree of confidence that our customers place in Zong Yih, our emphasis is on "problem prevention" and "continuous product improvement". In fact, certification to ISO9001:2008 was part of that emphasis - not a reaction.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>THE FIRST ARTICLE PROCESS</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">From the inception of a project, Quality plays a major role. We work hard to learn up front, and then respond to, a customer's unique quality concerns. We then work those requirements into the incoming materials requirements, process requirements, and finished standards for the product. With our First Article process, all functions - Engineering, Quality, Manufacturing and Customer Service - participate in establishing and confirming the specific steps that will ensure delivering the customer's product problem free and on-time the first and every time. As part of the process, involved operators are trained to inspect and statistically sample for their customer's specific requirements. Tools used to accomplish this process include ISIRs, SPCs, PPAPs and FMEAs.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>QUALITY REVIEW</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Quality Inspection lab at Zong Yih is an exceptionally well-equipped facility, but our facility is only a minor player in the overall quality process. As part of the quality review process, quality becomes a part of the project right from the start. Our Engineering and Sales team completes a formal design review when the project is initiated. This is often followed up by cross-departmental new part FMEAs. As a standard practice, ISIRs are provided to our customers with the first article shipment. Of course, our QA Inspector provides complete PPAPs when requested. In addition to our focus on quality during the first article process, each operator involved in the flow of the product is trained to inspect for quality during his or her operation for each and every production release. Our operators are our most effective inspectors. Weekly continuous improvement meetings involving production, engineering and quality are held to improve our process and reduce the cost of scrap. From the start of a new project through regular manufacturing production releases, our entire quality process is set up to ensure the highest quality</span>.</span></p>]]></description>

			<title>R &amp; D Formulation</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Excellent Team for Rubber Material Technology</strong></span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We understand that even the best-designed part in the world can still fail if it's not made of the right material. That's why we pay close attention to application variables and help our customers choose the best material for each situation. If need be, we can formulate and test custom compounds in our very own material development laboratories. Our material labs focus on mixing and milling, curing and aging, and physical testing of finished compounds. Taken together, those endeavors allow us to achieve just the right blend of properties before a single part is molded.</span></p>
<p style="color: #000000; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The end result of our efforts? Our expertise in material development ultimately results in useful, effective compounds, and, by extension, product reliability. Best of all, that reliability, by further extension, results in even greater peace of mind for our customers, who can rely on our products to perform in the field as expected.</span></p>]]></description>
